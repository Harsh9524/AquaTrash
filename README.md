# AquaTrash

This dataset contains 369 images of Trash used for deep learning. Each image is manually labelled by our team for accurate detections making a total of 470 bounding boxes. There are total 4 classes {(0: glass), (1:paper), (2:metal), (3:plastic)}

# Usage
1. Each image stored in the images folder has one or more labelled bounding boxes. 
2. The labelled bounding box are stored in the annotations.csv file with the following format:
  ```
  <file_path>,<x_min>,<y_min>,<x_max>,<y_max>
  ```
